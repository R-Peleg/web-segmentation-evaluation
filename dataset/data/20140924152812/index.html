<h1>Terms and Conditions of Use - Image Bank Sweden</h1>

<p>Acceptance of the Terms and Conditions of Use means that the user has read all the Terms and Conditions below. The Terms and Conditions of Use are binding on all users. The user must at all times note that an image may be subject to alternative conditions, additional conditions, which, if so, are provided in connection with the downloading of the image.

<p></p>

<h2>Use of images from Image Bank Sweden</h2>

<p>Images from the image bank may, unless other terms and conditions have been specified for a particular image, be used free of charge for the purpose of promoting Sweden abroad or to a foreign target audience in Sweden. Foreign target audience means, for example, use in connection with an international conference in Sweden, or by a Chinese student in Sweden who blogs in Chinese. The above-stated applies to both printed and digital use. </p>

<p>Marketing of products or services for the purpose of increasing travel to Sweden is permitted. (For example, it is permissible for a hotel or university in Sweden to market its services abroad in order to attract guests or students to come to Sweden.)</p>

<p>Use is permitted in a commercial context in which Sweden is promoted, for example, a company that presents Sweden abroad (in a customer magazine, presentation, event or the like) without directly marketing its product or service. Merely using an image without clear reference to Sweden is not deemed to promote Sweden and is, therefore, prohibited. Nor is the fact that a company has Sweden or references to Sweden in its company name, profile, payoff or the like sufficient basis for use.</p>

<p>Images may not be used in a context aimed at Swedish audiences in Sweden. However, use for Swedish-speaking audiences abroad is permitted.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Terms and Conditions shall apply in conjunction with the restrictions set forth below.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Terms and Conditions of Use also apply to the organizations in the Council for the Promotion of Sweden. For any additional terms and conditions for the organizations in the Council for the Promotion of Sweden, see Sweden Promotion Forum. [link]</p>

<h2>User</h2>
<p>The user is solely responsible for all image use. The user is also required to hold the organizations responsible for the image bank harmless from claims from image rightsholders due to any use which violates these Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h2>Rights, limitations, and data storage</h2>
<p>The user acquires a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use images from Image Bank Sweden. Images may not be assigned, licensed, rented or otherwise copied or distributed to third parties. The right to use the image must be exercised within six (6) months from the downloading of the image. The user may not store the image for other than the specific use which was contemplated at the time of downloading. Otherwise, in order to ensure that it remains available and to obtain any new Terms and Conditions associated with the image, the image must be downloaded from Image Bank Sweden again before it may be used.</p> 

<p>Each of the organizations behind Image Bank Sweden reserves the right to prohibit a specific user from using the images provided and to withdraw rights to certain individual images without any further explanation. In conjunction with such a withdrawal, the user shall delete the downloaded image, and, to the extent that it is possible, remove the image from where it is used. </p>

<h2>Indication of Name</h2>
<p>The photographer's name and Image Bank Sweden shall be indicated as close to the image as possible, as follows: name of photographer/imagebank.sweden.se.</p>

<p>Where no indication of name has been provided, the user may be charged for the omission of the creator’s and/or rightsholder’s name.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The organizations in the Council for the Promotion of Sweden shall not be liable for loss of access to images, due to technical faults, force majeure or other circumstances.</p>

<p>The organizations in the Council for the Promotion of Sweden shall not be liable for inaccurate image information, which is due to incorrect information supplied by third parties.</p>

<h2>Improper use</h2>
<p>Images from Image Bank Sweden may not be used in any manner inconsistent with Swedish or international law. The images may not be used in any manner or context which might be perceived as offensive, misleading or illegal (for example, pornographic or obscene). The images may not be used in such a manner that may offend or be defamatory to the photographer and/or people depicted in the image.</p>

<p>The user is liable for any claims for damages which may arise as a result of claims brought by copyright holders or people depicted in the image due to improper use.</p>

<h2>Copyright</h2>
<p>All material in Image Bank Sweden is protected under the Copyright Act. This means that all copyrighted content, structure, design, selection, language, graphics, images, as well as all code, html, javascript, or the like is protected and not transferred to the user.</p>

<h2>Disputes</h2>

<p>Disputes concerning the interpretation or application of these Terms and Conditions shall be adjudicated under Swedish law by the Stockholm District Court.</p>
