# GroundTruth Web Page Segmentation Construction
## MOB - Manual Design Of Blocks

In order to help human assessors building a Web page segmentation (ground truth) we developped the tool MoB (Manual-design-Of-Blocks). 
It is designed as a browser extension and offers functionalities to expert users for creating a manual segmentations.
Users can create blocks based on Web page elements. They can merge blocks, navigate into the element hierarchy to produce a block graph, or produce a flat segmentation (i.e. leaves in the block tree). These segmentations are stored in arepository for the evaluation.
